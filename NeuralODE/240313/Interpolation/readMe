# Individual Neural networks
Given the exerimental data, we interpolate the data using NN. 


## Details
We have an individual NN for interpolating each of mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis.
The loss has been excellent. 0.0001
        
The number of epochs were based on the loss function >=0.0001.

The learning rates have been pretty high. 0.01.
