# Understanding the system
With the NN developed in 230309 for the dyncamical system, we study how it would trace at different initial conditions.

## Description:
We have one NN for each of dm/dt, dv/dt, dk/dt, ds/dt.
We also the experimental data from Prof. Curt. There are 43 experimental points in total. 
Now we will see how the system looks (visual observation) when it has been initialised at different inital points.  

note: the pth files are developed for system 2. (system 2 is the system corresponding to the NN system. (not the nn interpolation.)
